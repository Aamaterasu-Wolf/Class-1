    <p> Genshin Impact[b] is an action role-playing game developed and published by miHoYo. 
        It was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, iOS, and Android in 2020, and on PlayStation 5 in 2021, and is set for release on Nintendo Switch. The game features an anime-style open-world environment and an action-based battle system using elemental magic and character-switching. The game is free-to-play and is monetized through gacha game mechanics through which players can obtain new characters and weapons. 
        The base game is expanded on a regular basis through patches using the games as a service model.
